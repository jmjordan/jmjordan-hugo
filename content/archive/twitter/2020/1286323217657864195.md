> folklore will have 16 songs on the standard edition, but the physical deluxe editions will include a bonus track “the lakes.” Because this is my 8th studio album, I made 8 deluxe CDs &amp; 8 deluxe vinyls available for 1 week😄 Each has unique covers &amp; photos [store.taylorswift.com](https://store.taylorswift.com)
