98. Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942) directed by Michael Curtiz

I was familiar with ‘Over There’ and ‘Yankee Doodle Boy’ but I never knew who wrote them. And while I’ve never been into “classic” films, I quite enjoyed this in the end.  🎥🍿 #AFI100 [letterboxd.com/film/yankee-doodle-dandy/](https://letterboxd.com/film/yankee-doodle-dandy/)
