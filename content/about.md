**👋🏻 Hi, I'm Jonathan!**

I grew up in South Carolina and currently live in San Jose, California where I work as a Software Engineer. I primarily build iOS apps, but in general I love creating (and occasionally finishing) everything.

When I'm not building things I enjoy:

* 📚 Learning new things
* 👱‍♀️ Listening to Taylor Swift
* 🏈 Watching Clemson football
* 📷 Taking photos
* 🏳️‍🌈 Fighting for equality
