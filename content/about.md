**👋🏻 Hi, I'm Jonathan!**

I grew up in South Carolina and currently live in San Jose, California where I work as a Software Engineer. I primarily build iOS apps, but in general I love creating (and occasionally finishing) everything.

When I'm not building things I enjoy:

* 📚 Learning new things
* 👱‍♀️ Listening to Taylor Swift
* 🏈 Watching Clemson football
* 📷 Taking photos
* 🏳️‍🌈 Fighting for equality

If you'd like to chat you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jmjordan), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/jmjordan), or by good old-fashioned [email](mailto:jonathan@jmjordan.com) (bonus points for using my [public key](/keys/8001AD76916EC342B949AB1C43D44039208C0BE6.asc)).
